What I Learned in Week 0

I learned how to navigate using terminal. This allows an advanced amount of control. Being able to create,move and manipulate directories and files through terminal saves time on always open and manually looking for things. 

I learned about gitHub. I learned that if you work with food, you will tend to say grubhub when you mean github and vice versa. I learned the standard commands of git add (adds files to index), git commit (records changes), git push (updates changes to index)and git pull (retrieves data from index).
